Different parts of ReCaged are released under different licenses, GPL version 3
unless where otherwise stated, and...

Licensing information of binary media files is specified in a README file in
the same directory as the relevant media file. However, all files are released
under the same terms as above (GPL version 3), unless stated otherwise inside
the file or in an accompanying README file.

... For full licenses too long to include directly in/for each file, see the
files inside the "licensing" directory ...
