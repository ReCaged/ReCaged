#input mapping syntax:
#
# action input_type input
#
#where action is one of:
#  up, down, right, left, drift_brake,
#  camera1, camera2, camera3, camera4
#
#and input_type and input is one of:
#
#  key keyboard_key
#  axis joystick_axis axis_min axis_max
#  button joystick_button
#  hat joystick_hat hat_direction
#
#note1: axis_min/axis_max are in the interval: -32768 to 32767
#note2: axis_min/axis_max specifies center+dead zone and range.
#note3: when axis is used as a button, axis_min is threshold

#keyboard: bind to arrow keys and space for locking brakes
forward key up
reverse key down
right key right
left key left
drift_brake key space

#camera change with F1-F4
camera1 key f1
camera2 key f2
camera3 key f3
camera4 key f4

#simple default for joysticks/gamepads
#axes:
forward axis 1 -500 -32000
reverse axis 1 500 32000
right axis 0 500 32000
left axis 0 -500 -32000
#buttons:
forward button 0
reverse button 1
drift_brake button 2
camera1 button 3
camera2 button 4
camera3 button 5
camera4 button 6
#hat
forward hat 0 up 
reverse hat 0 down 
right hat 0 right 
left hat 0 left 

#note: if you got analog shoulder buttons, they are probably
#mapped as two axis resting at -32768 (fully pressed at 32767)
#they can be mapped as (assuming the axes are 5 and 2):
#(just uncomment the follwing lines. it's really good!)
#forward axis 5 -3200 32000
#reverse axis 2 -3200 32000
#drift_brake button 0
