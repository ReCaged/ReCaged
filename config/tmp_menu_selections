#this file is meant to solve some problems with the current lack of menus.
#the current race mode is just a debug mode thing:
# one single user (with one profile) controls all cars ("players")
#
#the idea here is to mimic menu selections for now:
#hello, welcome to recaged!
#select a profile (or create a new):
profile default

#main menu...
#player selects "race"...
#and free-roam mode...
#select world:
world Sandbox
#select track:
track Box

#waiting for players...
#one player joins the cage
#please select team:
team Nemesis
#what car?
car Venom
#ok, wheel? (global, world or track specific)
wheel Slipstream #belongs to choosen world

#todo: automatic starting position instead of
#manual x and y coords relative to track start
start -8 0

#another player joins the cage
team Nemesis
car Venom
diameter 2
wheel Reckon #can be used in any world
start 8 0

#ok, end of file: cage is closed, race will start!
