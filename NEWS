RCX 0.8.0 "The Devil's Mind is an Idle Workshop" (?/?/2015)
---------------------------------------------------------------
 * Change of name: "ReCaged" is now "RCX"

 * Move to Autotools (Automake, Autoconf) for building

 * Detect if running in "installed" or "portable" mode
   * Uses xdg or platform-specific paths when installed

 * NSIS installer for windows

 * Support for OS X

 * New test track:
   * Ramps and stunt object by CodieMorgan/MoruganKodi/コディ[KODI]
   * Scramble-like test road and ramps by orgyia
TODO:   * Rework superbowl and vertigo roads
TODO:   * New tracks and cars by Codie?

 * New logging system
TODO: * Colour indication of importance/verbosity
   * Realtime log output now also on windows
   * Writes full log output to file
   * Errors written to stderr (and displayed in message box on windows)

 * Fixed various insufficient memory allocations

 * Interface improvements:
   * Joystick (gamepad) support
   * Anti-Aliasing support (multisample)
   * More reliable window creation (native BPP, better fullscreen support)
   * Use native screen resolution for fullscreen mode
   * Better information output regarding window creation/resize

 * Simulation improvements:
   * Increased simulation stability
   * Simulation does not speed up to catch up with realtime (after lag) anymore
   * Non-zero surface layer depth (less jitter/improved collision stability)
   * New air/liquid drag simulation calculation (both linear and rotational)
   * Added per-axis rotational drag coefficients (used by cars, like linear)

 * Camera improvements:
   * More reliable movement (more responsive, bumper camera perfectly still)
   * New damping/drag simulation
   * Hopefully all potential NaN position/rotation results can now be avoided

 * Car improvements:
   * New, more powerful, downforce
   * Major reconfiguration of Venom car
   * New tyre friction simulation model (more stable, easier to configure)
   * New tyre combined slip/grip model
   * New tyre/rim contact point evaluation
   * New load/normal force calculations for tyre contact points
   * Each wheel now stores its own set of parameters (independent of car, can
     support unattached wheels, different front/rear wheel handling and so on)
   * Wheel axles can now break (more a proof-of-concept than actual gameplay)
   * New soft brake/brake-throttle transition code (more reliable at low speed)
   * New rolling resistance code (more reliable at low speed/uneven terrain)
   * Less bending of wheel axles at high speeds (finite rotation for axles)
   *..... TODO!

 * Code reorganization:
   * Renamed "loaders" to "assets"
   * Removed "../" from header inclusions (src is now in the inclusion paths)
   * Renamed "Object_Template" and "Car_Template" to "Module" and "Car_Module"

 * TODO!
