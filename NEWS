 * Increased simulation stability

 * Car improvements:
   * Major reconfiguration of Venom car
   * New tyre friction simulation model (more stable, easier to configure)
   * New tyre combined slip/grip model
   * New tyre/rim contact point evaluation
   * New load/normal force calculations for tyre contact points
   * Each wheel now stores its own set of parameters (independent of car, can
     support unattached wheels, different front/rear wheel handling and imilar)
   * Wheel axles can now break (more a proof-of-concept than actual gameplay)
   * New soft-brake/rolling-resistance code (more reliable at low speeds)
   * Less bending of wheel axles at high speeds
   *..... TODO!
