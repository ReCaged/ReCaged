RCX 0.8.0 "The Devil's Mind is an Idle Workshop" (?/?/2015)
---------------------------------------------------------------
TODO: more stuff here!
 * Change of name: "ReCaged" is now "RCX"

 * Move to Autotools (Automake, Autoconf) for building

 * Added simple script ("build.sh") for automating tedious builds (w32 for now)

 * Detect if running in "installed" or "portable" mode
   * Uses xdg or platform-specific paths when installed
   * Automatic detection and paths can be overridden by invocation arguments

 * New set of invocation flags and arguments (includes long arguments)

 * NSIS installer for windows

 * Support for OS X

 * Fixed various insufficient memory allocations

 * Separate tyre and rim models replaced by single wheel models (by world/track)

 * New models and tracks:
   * New wheels, ramps and stunt objects by CodieMorgan/MoruganKodi/コディ[KODI]
   * Scramble-like test road by orgyia
   * superbowl and vertigo roads reworked to be much more pleasant to drive

 * New logging system:
   * Realtime log output now also on windows
   * Writes complete log output to log file
   * Errors written to stderr (and displayed in message box on windows)

 * Interface improvements:
   * Joystick (gamepad) support
   * Anti-Aliasing support (multisample)
   * More reliable window creation (native BPP, better fullscreen support)
   * Use native screen resolution for fullscreen mode
   * Better information output regarding window creation/resize

 * Simulation improvements:
   * Increased simulation stability
   * Simulation does not speed up to catch up with realtime (after lag) anymore
   * Non-zero surface layer depth (less jitter/improved collision stability)
   * New air/liquid drag simulation calculation (both linear and rotational)
   * Added per-axis rotational drag coefficients (used by cars, like linear)

 * Camera improvements:
   * More reliable movement (more responsive, bumper camera perfectly still)
   * New damping/drag simulation
   * Hopefully all potential NaN position/rotation results can now be avoided
   * Camera settings are now car-specific, not defined in player profile
   * Modified camera (position) can now be reset without restarting the game

 * Car improvements:
   * New, more powerful, downforce
   * Major reconfiguration of "Venom" car
   * New tyre friction simulation model (more stable, easier to configure)
   * New tyre combined slip/grip model
   * New tyre/rim contact point evaluation
   * New load/normal force calculations for tyre contact points
   * Each wheel now stores its own set of parameters (independent of car, can
     support unattached wheels, different front/rear wheel handling and so on)
   * Wheel axles can now break (more a proof-of-concept than actual gameplay)
   * Smarter transition between brakes and throttle, more reliable at low speed
   * New rolling resistance code (more reliable at low speed/uneven terrain)
   * Less bending of wheel axles at high speeds (finite rotation for axles)
   *..... TODO!

 * Major code reorganizations:
   * Renamed directory "shared" to "common"
   * Renamed directory "loaders" to "assets"
   * Renamed "Racetime_Data" to "Assets"
   * Moved most code from "common" to "assets" and "simulation"
   * Created "Thread" struct for thread local data (will become important)
   * Renamed "Object_Template" and "Car_Template" to "Module" and "Car_Module"
   * Renamed "Trimesh" and "..._Geom/_3D" to "Model" and "..._Mesh/_Draw"
   * Removed "../" from header inclusions (src is now in the inclusion paths)
