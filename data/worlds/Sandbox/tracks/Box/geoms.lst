#be divided into smaller pieces (also true for all models with high number of
#triangles)

#model manipulation:

#surface options:
#affects latest spawned geom (used after spawned geom)
# > surface TYPE [OPTION VALUE]...
#
#where type can be just "global" or "material" followed by a name of a
#material used by the model. the first one is most common, and sets one surface
#for the whole geom the second one affects (and enables) surfaces based on the
#material of the model
#
#when surface based on material is enabled, the current global surface will be
#disabled, and its current values are copied to all materials (as defaults
#until changed)
#
#default values:
# mu 0.0
# bounce 0.0
# spring inf
# damping 0.0
# sensitivity 1.0
# rollres 1.0
#
#except for sensitivity and rollres (which affects wheels), all values are
#mixed with the same values from the colliding surface: sensitivity changes how
#how easily friction is gained/lost (as slipangle/-rate increases), rollres
#changes rolling resistance
#
#if spring is set to infinity (inf) on both colliding surfaces, the collision
#is simulated as hard (using values defined in internal.conf), otherwise soft


#specify the default global mu for all future geoms

#since roads can easily become very big (with many triangles), they should be
#divided into smaller pieces for optimization:
# * reoccuring parts are reused
# * rendering of only the visible parts
# * collision detection on only triangles of potentially colliding parts

#todo: should probably implement inclusion of multiple geoms.lst files through
#this file, or some way of splitting ".road" files...
