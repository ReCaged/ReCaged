#visual properties:
#

#blue sky (clearing colour)
background 0.53 0.81 0.92

#near and far clipping distances
clipping 1 1500

#fog
#modes:
#0: disabled
#1: linear (good for making a "wall of fog" to hide far clipping)
#2: exponential (more realistic fog, but never completely blocks vision)
#3: square exponential (similar, more feeling of depth)

#note: linear mode uses the "fog:range" parameter, the others use "fog:density"

#fade to background colour to hide the far clipping plane:
fog:mode 3 #exp^2
fog:density 0.0015 #just about hides the far clipping
fog:colour 0.53 0.81 0.92 #same as background

#sun direction and colour
position -1.0 0.5 1.0 0.0 #x,y,z position or direction (if last is 1 or 0)
ambient 0.0 0.0 0.0 #(shaded areas are still a bit visible...)
